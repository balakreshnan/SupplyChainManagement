# SCM - Supply Chain Management

What is Supply Chain Management and where we can infuse AI

## Supply Chain Management Business focus area

## Planning: 

This involves forecasting demand, planning inventory levels, and scheduling production and delivery to ensure that supply meets demand efficiently.
- Opportunity to use Machine learning, Deep learning and Reinforcement learning
- Forecast or LSTM type approaches are important
- Univariant and Multi variant type modelling
- Need Orders to delivery and their time frame
- Based on vendor inventory or their production, align raw materials, or components on time
- Predict how qty from vendor who can delivery based on current inventory, location of inventory and other sources
- Able to have a UI to change parameters to apply and see how we inventory delivery can change.
- For example: i need to procure 100 10volt DC motor and who can we predict to source for us within dec 2024.
- Enable natural language to search vendors, ask for when they can deliver based on their capacity of production

## Sourcing: 

The process of selecting suppliers who will provide the goods and services needed for the production process. This includes negotiating contracts, managing relationships, and ensuring that the materials meet quality standards.
- Collect inventory from vendors
- Also get the estimate time to delivery from vendors
- Vendors are distributed across globe or some focused countries
- Shipping from vendors storage or manufacturing plant may vary depending on products procured.
- Also some raw materials or perishable goods have to be kept in certain temperature and also goal will be keep it safe
- Here also there is forecasting, predicting like LSTM on when supplier can source inventory on time.
- Enabling natural language UI to analyze and predict will be awesome tool
- Contract negoitiation and abilityt to search previous contracts for price and also delivery time insights
- Vast amount of products and vast amounts of vendors, and each raw materials can be sourced by multiple vendors.
- Quantity and vendor production capacity forecasting and providing insights.
- Invetory management using vision to know when to replenish products or raw materials
- Products and raw materials storage location for faster picking.

## Manufacturing: 

This is the actual production phase where raw materials are transformed into finished products. It involves managing the production process, ensuring quality control, and optimizing production schedules.
- Factory GPT for line's to help operate and troubleshoot line for specific product
- Lean Manufacturing GPT for recipe and product manufacturing process insights.
- Quality predictions using Vision AI and Multi model GPT
- Able to understand and reason computer aided design drawings of the line.
- Workplace Safety system's using vision based to report accident's or other compliance related stuff to OSHA compliance
- Document Intelligence for report and other input forms in plant floor.
- Creating process and documentation for line operations as the reipe changes
- Knowledge worker GPT - provide information to the factory workers on information related to work environment, HR, other compliance for entire facility.
- Inventory management for stations to replenish products or raw materials
- Delivery products or raw materials on time using autonomous vehicle to stations for production or assembling a complete product
- Work order Management details using Gen AI or even better use voice to ask for work order information and work instruction as needed.
- Facotry workers time reporting based on task they do using Vision Systems
- Predictive Maintenance on stations, line or entire factory process to improve production and reduce downtime
- Vibration analysis and audio based equipment defect prediction.
- Manufacturing ware house inventory and location management.

## Delivery and Logistics: 

This encompasses the storage, transportation, and distribution of goods to the final customer. It includes managing warehouses, selecting transportation modes, and ensuring timely delivery.
- Ware house management
- Ware house location mapping for faster loading and unloading
- Inventory management vision AI based alert system
- Logistics partners contract GPT to understand their delviery process and time.
- Gen ai to understand various criteria when delivery is delayed.
- Weather, war, country specific restrictions, natural disaster based fastest distribution creation.
- Perishable goods have certain specification to transport in any means, monitor and predict if it can go bad or not.
- Vison AI based monitoring system, that can be changed for different perishable goods by changing model, not the entire system.
  
## Return Management: 

Also known as reverse logistics, this involves handling returned products, managing refunds, repairs, and recycling processes.
- Waranty exchange estimated arrival time prediction
- Based on product feedback and troubleshooting, enable products documents and troubleshooting GPT to provide swift and fast response to customers
- Understanding recycling products and automatically splitting using Vision AI
- Detecting customer dissatisfaction and provide returns in the call center.
- Understand customer sentiments and product issues to provide feedback into engineering to reduce product returns
